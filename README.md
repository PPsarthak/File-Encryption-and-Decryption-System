# File-Encryption-and-Decryption-System
File encryption is the process of converting readable data into an unreadable form through the use of an encryption algorithm. The encrypted data can only be accessed by authorized parties with the appropriate decryption key. The need for encryption arises from the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks and data breaches, as it provides a critical layer of security for sensitive information. Encryption ensures that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be read by anyone without the decryption key, effectively rendering it useless.
There are several benefits to file encryption, including improved confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Encryption protects data from unauthorized access, ensuring that only authorized parties can access it. It also helps to prevent data tampering, as any unauthorized changes to the encrypted data would require the decryption key, which is only possessed by authorized parties. Additionally, encryption can be used to ensure the availability of data by preventing it from being corrupted or lost.
Previous models of file encryption, however, had some shortcomings. One of the primary issues was the key management system, which often proved to be complex and difficult to maintain. Additionally, some older encryption algorithms were found to be vulnerable to attacks, making them unsuitable for secure data storage. However, with advances in technology, modern encryption algorithms have been developed that are more secure and easier to manage.
As part of our project, we have implemented a File Encryption System using AES and Blowfish algorithms. Both are symmetric key algorithms. Additionally, a Cascading Algorithm is used that adds a AES layer and a Blowfish over the top of it to ensure maximum security. The GUI is made using the Swing and AWT. The GUI provides 6 buttons - 3 for encryption and 3 for decryption. Additionally there is a textfield where user can enter a customized key for encrypting.
